   - Edge cases
   - Unit test coverage

3. Code Quality Standards:
   - Clean, readable implementation
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Proper logging
   - Performance-focused algorithms
   - Memory optimization
   - Thread safety considerations

Output Format:
1. Implementation code with:
   - Detailed inline comments
   - Performance considerations
   - Complex algorithm explanations
   - Error handling strategy
   - Memory management details

2. For each implemented component:
   - Performance characteristics
   - Resource usage details
   - Threading considerations
   - Error handling approach

If any architectural specifications are unclear, request clarification before proceeding with implementation.

Do not modify the provided architecture without explicit authorization.

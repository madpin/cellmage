## Adding Your Own Integrations

CellMage is designed to be extensible. You can create your own integrations by:

1. Subclassing `BaseMagic` from `cellmage.integrations.base_magic`
2. Implementing the required methods
3. Registering your magic with the IPython kernel

See the [Developer Guide](../developer/index.md) for more details on creating custom integrations.

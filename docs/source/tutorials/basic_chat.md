# üí¨ Basic Chat: Mastering Simple LLM Conversations

Welcome to the Basic Chat tutorial! This guide will help you understand how to have effective conversations with Large Language Models (LLMs) using CellMage.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll discover:
- How to structure effective prompts
- The basics of conversation flow
- How to refine and improve LLM responses
- Best practices for clear communication with LLMs

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started with Basic Chat

Before diving in, make sure you have:
- CellMage installed (`pip install cellmage`)
- An API key configured (see the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) guide if needed)
- The extension loaded in your notebook:

```ipython
%load_ext cellmage.integrations.ipython_magic
```

## üó£Ô∏è Step 1: Your First Conversation

Let's start with a simple conversation:

```ipython
%%llm
Explain what makes a good prompt for an LLM. Keep it concise.
```

You'll notice the LLM responds with a concise explanation. But what if we want to follow up on this topic?

## üîÑ Step 2: Follow-Up Questions

CellMage maintains conversation context automatically, allowing for natural follow-ups:

```ipython
%%llm
Can you give me 3 specific examples of what you just explained?
```

The model remembers the previous discussion about good prompts and provides examples based on that context.

## üß© Step 3: Structuring More Complex Prompts

For more detailed responses, structure your prompt with clear sections:

```ipython
%%llm
I need information about Python's list comprehensions.

Please structure your response as follows:
1. A simple definition
2. Basic syntax with an example
3. Three advanced examples with explanations
4. Common pitfalls to avoid
```

Notice how providing a structure helps the LLM organize its response in a more useful way.

## üîÆ Step 4: Different Response Styles

You can request different styles or formats for responses:

```ipython
%%llm
Explain the concept of "technical debt" in software development.
First, explain it as if I'm a senior developer.
Then, explain the same concept as if I'm a non-technical project manager.
```

This approach is useful when you need explanations tailored to different audiences.

## üå°Ô∏è Step 5: Adjusting Temperature

The temperature parameter controls the creativity and randomness of responses:

```ipython
# More deterministic, focused response
%%llm --temperature 0.1
List 5 best practices for writing clean code.

# More creative, varied response
%%llm --temperature 0.8
List 5 best practices for writing clean code.
```

Compare the two responses. The lower temperature produces more predictable, conventional advice, while the higher temperature might introduce more unique or creative suggestions.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Step 6: Refining Responses

If a response isn't quite what you wanted, you can ask for refinements:

```ipython
%%llm
Your previous response about clean code was helpful, but could you focus more specifically on Python best practices and include examples for each?
```

This iterative refinement is one of the most powerful aspects of conversational LLMs.

## üéÆ Step 7: Controlling Response Length

You can guide the LLM to produce shorter or longer responses:

```ipython
%%llm
Explain quantum computing in 2-3 sentences only.
```

Or for a more detailed explanation:

```ipython
%%llm
I'd like an in-depth explanation of quantum computing, including:
- Key principles and concepts
- How it differs from classical computing
- Current limitations and challenges
- Potential future applications

Please be thorough and provide examples where helpful.
```

## üëî Step 8: Setting the Tone

You can request a specific tone for the response:

```ipython
%%llm
Write a brief explanation of blockchain technology with an enthusiastic tone.

Now, explain the same concept with a more formal, academic tone.
```

## üö´ Step 9: Handling Unhelpful Responses

If you receive a response that isn't helpful, you can:

```ipython
%%llm
That explanation wasn't quite what I was looking for. Let me clarify: I'm trying to understand blockchain specifically in terms of its application for supply chain tracking. Can you focus on that aspect?
```

## üß† Best Practices for Basic Chat

1. **Be Clear and Specific**: State exactly what you need
2. **Provide Context**: Give background information when needed
3. **Structure Complex Requests**: Use numbered lists or sections
4. **Iterate**: Refine your questions based on previous responses
5. **Experiment**: Try different prompts, temperatures, and approaches

## üîç Examining Your Chat History

To review your conversation:

```ipython
# Show your full conversation history
%llm_config --show-history
```

## üßπ Starting Fresh

When you want to start a new conversation without previous context:

```ipython
# Clear conversation history
%llm_config --clear-history
```

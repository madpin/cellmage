# 🧙 Overview: Unleash Your LLM Superpowers

## 🪄 What is CellMage?

CellMage is your magical companion for Jupyter notebooks, transforming ordinary code cells into powerful LLM interactions! Think of it as having an AI wizard 🧙‍♂️ sitting right next to you while you code, ready to assist whenever you summon it.

Under the hood, CellMage consists of several powerful magical components working together:

- **🧠 ChatManager**: The central orchestrator that handles LLM interactions and manages the conversation flow
- **📜 HistoryManager**: Keeps track of your conversation history and manages message persistence
- **🎭 Personas**: Predefined AI personalities with specific system prompts and parameters
- **📋 Snippets**: Reusable context blocks that can be injected into conversations
- **🔌 Adapters**: Connects to different LLM providers (OpenAI, compatible APIs, and more)
- **💾 Storage**: Saves your conversations using SQLite (default) or Markdown files for easy reference
- **🧩 Integrations**: Links CellMage to external tools like Jira, GitHub, GitLab, and Confluence

All these components work seamlessly together to create a frictionless LLM experience in your notebook environment.

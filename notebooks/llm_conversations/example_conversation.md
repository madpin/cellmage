What are the main features of the cellmage library?

**Assistant:**
Cellmage is a library designed for modeling and simulating cellular networks, particularly focusing on resource management, mobility, and network performance. Its main features include:

1. **Cellular Network Simulation:** Enables detailed modeling of cellular network components such as base stations, user equipment (UE), and their interactions.
2. **Resource Allocation:** Supports algorithms for frequency, time, and power management to optimize network efficiency.
3. **Mobility Modeling:** Provides tools to simulate user movement and handover procedures between cells.
4. **Network Performance Analysis:** Includes metrics and visualization tools to evaluate coverage, capacity, and quality of service.
5. **Flexible Architecture:** Designed to be extensible for various cellular standards and customization of network scenarios.
6. **Integration Capabilities:** Can interface with other simulation tools and datasets for comprehensive network analysis.

(Note: For specific details or updates beyond October 2023, please consult the official Cellmage documentation or repository.)

How would you implement a simple caching system in Python?

**Assistant:**
To implement a simple caching system in Python, you can use a dictionary to store computed results for quick retrieval. Here's a basic example using a decorator to cache function results:

```python
# Simple caching decorator
def simple_cache(func):
    cache = {}

    def wrapper(*args):
        if args in cache:
            print("Retrieving from cache")
            return cache[args]
        result = func(*args)
        cache[args] = result
        return result

    return wrapper

# Example usage
@simple_cache
def compute_square(n):
    print(f"Computing square of {n}")
    return n * n

# Testing
print(compute_square(4))  # Computes and caches result
print(compute_square(4))  # Retrieves result from cache
print(compute_square(5))  # Computes and caches result
```

**Key points:**
- Uses a dictionary (`cache`) to store results keyed by function arguments.
- Checks if the result for given arguments exists; if so, returns it directly.
- Otherwise, computes, stores, and returns the result.

This is a simple, in-memory cache suitable for small-scale or single-process applications. For more advanced caching, consider using `functools.lru_cache` or external caching solutions like Redis.

Sure! How about **"VisuNest"**?

*Meaning:* A playful combination of **"Visual"** and **"Nest"**, suggesting a cozy, organized space for all your data visualization needs. It evokes the idea of wrapping your

**System:**
```python
def calculate_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return calculate_fibonacci(n-1) + calculate_fibonacci(n-2)
```

**You:**
Can you explain this fibonacci function and suggest how to make it more efficient?

**Assistant:**
Certainly! The Fibonacci function provided is a classic recursive implementation:

```python
def calculate_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return calculate_fibonacci(n-1) + calculate_fibonacci(n-2)
```

**Explanation:**
- For `n <= 0`, it returns 0.
- For `n == 1`, it returns 1.
- For larger `n`, it recursively calculates the sum of the two previous Fibonacci numbers.

**Issues:**
- **Inefficiency:** It recalculates the same Fibonacci numbers multiple times, leading to exponential time complexity (`O(2^n)`).
- **Stack Overflow:** For large `n`, deep recursion might cause stack overflow errors.

**More Efficient Approach:**

1. **Iterative Method:** Use a loop to compute Fibonacci numbers in linear time (`O(n)`).

```python
def fibonacci_iterative(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```

2. **Memoization (Caching):** Store previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations.

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci_memo(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci_memo(n-1) + fibonacci_memo(n-2)
```

**Summary:**  
- The iterative version is simple and efficient for most use cases.  
- Memoization improves the recursive approach by avoiding repeated calculations, achieving `O(n)` time complexity.

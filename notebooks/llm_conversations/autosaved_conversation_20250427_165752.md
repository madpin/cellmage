**You:**
What are the primary features of Python as a programming language? List 5 key features with brief explanations.

**Assistant:**
Certainly! Here are five primary features of Python as a programming language:

1. **Easy to Read and Write**: Python uses simple, clear syntax that resembles natural language, making it beginner-friendly and easy to understand.

2. **Interpreted Language**: Python code is executed line-by-line by the interpreter, which simplifies debugging and eliminates the need for compilation.

3. **High-Level Language**: Python abstracts many complex hardware details, allowing developers to focus on problem-solving rather than low-level programming.

4. **Dynamically Typed**: Variable types are determined at runtime, providing flexibility and ease during development without explicit type declarations.

5. **Extensive Standard Library and Support for Multiple Paradigms**: Python offers a vast standard library for various tasks (e.g., file I/O, web development, data analysis), and supports multiple programming paradigms like procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

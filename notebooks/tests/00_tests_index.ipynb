    "\n",
    "1. **Functionality Verification**: They allow you to verify that all features of CellMage are working correctly in your environment\n",
    "2. **Installation Checking**: They help confirm that your installation has been properly set up\n",
    "3. **API Integration**: They verify that your API credentials are working and properly configured\n",
    "4. **Learning Resource**: They demonstrate usage patterns and serve as practical examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike tutorials that focus on teaching concepts or examples that show real-world applications, test notebooks are specifically designed to systematically test functionality."
